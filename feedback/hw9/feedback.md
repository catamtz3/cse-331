## Code quality and implementation

### Design: 2/3

- You should not have a hardcoded list of buildings in path.tsx.

- In general it's best to make the name of your tsx files align with the name of the class within in. Your path.tsx naming is confusing as it appears it doesn't actually have anything to do with pathfinding.
