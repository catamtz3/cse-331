1. Multiplication Pseudocode
    r = p * q;
    set r = q by making a term-by-term copy of all terms in q to r;
    {Inv: r = q * p0 * p1 * ... * pi-1}
    foreach term tp in p:
        if tr has the same degree of tp
            then replace tr in r with the multiplication of tp and tr
            else get rid of tr
        return r


2. Division Pseudocode
        r = p / q;
        set r = p by making a term-by-term copy of all terms in p to r
        {Inv: r = p / q0 / q1/ ... / qi-1 && p.term >= q.term}
        while p.term >= q.term
            r = p.term - q.term
        if r.term >= 0



3. Division Example: (x3+x-1) / (x+1) = x2-x+2




## Part 1

1. Weakened Rep Invariant
    In order for the code to function with a weakened invariant, the methods .equals() and .toString() would
    have to be altered. The method .equals() is checking to see if the RatNum is the same and it's not taking into
    account if the fraction is reduced or not, which will cause errors. .toString() would also have to be changed
    because in the method description it says that the fraction will be reduced, and the current method is
    counting on the fraction already being reduced previously so it has no reduction measures in its code.
    These can be fixed by simply adding code to each method that'd reduce the fraction, but it takes up
    more lines than it does currently and is less efficient.


2. Alternate add, sub, mul, div
    The spec requires that the code is immutable, therefore making it mutable is breaking its own requirements.
    For this change, the effects and requires for the methods will have to be shifted to match the mutable change.


3. Constructor checkReps
    The class RatNum is immutable, so it's only necessary to check if it breaks the invariant at the constructor
    because it won't be altered throughout the code.

1. Calls to checkRep in RatTerm
    I called checkRep at the end of my constructors because the class is immutable.


2. Weakened Rep Invariant



3. Alternate Rep Invariant
    The only change necessary would be to alter the constructor to initialize NaN with exponent 0.
    toString() could also be altered to return "NaN^0" instead of just NaN. Creating NaN like this would
    add few lines of code, but it doesn't alter complexity by very much.


4. Preferred Invariants
    After looking at the methods, altering the code to fit in NaN with exponent zero has hardly any more work
    required. It could easily be implemented, so I prefer this one.



## Part 3
###########################################################################

1. Calls to checkRep in RatPoly
    I called checkRep at the constructor because the class is once again immutable so it is unnecessary to call
    it anywhere else.


2. Alternate Representation
    Switching the code from what it is currently to lists wouldn't be too different. The RatPolys are already stored
    in terms of coefficients and efficients, so it's just a matter of switching syntax to match. Creating lists would
    create the need for slightly more code in construction, but besides that it would be relatively similar.
    I'd prefer storing the exponent and coefficient in two separate lists. It was hard for me to understand the syntax
    of the original RatPoly and getting used to calling the functions, and my mind can better visualize the concepts
    in lists even if it's slighlty more work.
