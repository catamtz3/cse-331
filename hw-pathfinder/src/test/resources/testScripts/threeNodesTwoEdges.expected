created graph twoNodes

added node a to twoNodes
added node b to twoNodes
added node c to twoNodes

added edge 10.0 from a to b to twoNodes
added edge 5.0 from a to c to twoNodes

twoNodes contains: a, b, c

the children of a in twoNodes are: b(10.0) c(5.0)

path from a to c:
a to b with weight 10.0
b to c with weight 5.0
total cost: 15.0
