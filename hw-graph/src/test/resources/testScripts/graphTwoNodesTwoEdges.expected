# Create a graph
created graph twoEdges

#Add two nodes to the graph
added node a to twoEdges
added node b to twoEdges

#Add one edge between nodes a and b
added edge ab from a to b in twoEdges

#Add one edge between nodes b and a
added edge ba from b to a in twoEdges

# Get the nodes of the graph
twoEdges contains: a b

# Get the children of the graph
the children of a in twoEdges are: b(ab)
the children of b in twoEdges are: a(ba)
