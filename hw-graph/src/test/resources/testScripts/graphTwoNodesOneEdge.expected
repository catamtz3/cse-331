# Create a graph
created graph twoNodes

#Add two nodes to the graph
added node a to twoNodes
added node b to twoNodes

#Add one edge between nodes a and b
added edge ab from a to b in twoNodes

# Get the nodes of the graph
twoNodes contains: a b

# Get the children of the graph
the children of a in twoNodes are: b(ab)
